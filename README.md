## Creating GIFs

Embedding an animated gif in your README quickly demonstrates what your project does and catches the reader's eye.  Here are a few programs that can help you quickly create gifs for your project:

- [Gifox](https://gifox.io) - **$4.99** - Cleanest UI, hotkeys, lots of advanced features
- [Giphy Capture](https://giphy.com/apps/giphycapture) - **FREE** - Easy to upload to giphy.com, slightly annoying UX.
- [LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) - **FREE** - Less intuitive, more features
- [Recordit](http://recordit.co/) - **FREE** - Simple, clean UI, but auto-uploads to [recordit.co](http://recordit.co)
- [ttystudio](https://github.com/chjj/ttystudio) - **FREE** - For commandline tools, a terminal-to-gif recorder minus the headaches.
